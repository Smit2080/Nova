I'll use Flask, a popular Python web framework, to create a basic web UI.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to create the web UI:\n\n**Step 1: Install Flask**\n\nWe'll need to install Flask using pip:\n```bash\npip install flask\n```\n**Step 2: Create a new Flask app**\n\nCreate a new file called `app.py` and add the following code:\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef index():\n    return render_template(\"index.html\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\nThis code creates a new Flask app and defines a single route for the root URL (`\"/\"`).\n\n**Step 3: Create an HTML template**\n\nCreate a new file called `templates/index.html` and add the following code:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Agent UI</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Agent UI</h1>\n    <form action=\"/upgrade\" method=\"post\">\n      <label for=\"upgrade\">Upgrade Agent:</label>\n      <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Upgrade\">\n    </form>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\nThis code creates a simple HTML form with a single button that submits a POST request to the `/upgrade` URL.\n\n**Step 4: Create a route for the upgrade endpoint**\n\nAdd the following code to `app.py`:\n```python\n@app.route(\"/upgrade\", methods=[\"POST\"])\ndef upgrade():\n    # TO DO: implement upgrade logic here\n    return \"Upgrade successful!\"\n```\nThis code defines a new route for the `/upgrade` URL that accepts POST requests.\n\n**Step 5: Implement upgrade logic**\n\nWe'll need to implement the logic for upgrading the agent. For now, let's just print a message to the console:\n```python\n@app.route(\"/upgrade\", methods=[\"POST\"])\ndef upgrade():\n    print(\"Upgrading agent...\")\n    return \"Upgrade successful!\"\n```\nThis code prints a message to the console when the upgrade button is clicked.\n\n**Step 6: Run the app**\n\nRun the app using the following command:\n```bash\npython app.py\n```\nThis will start the Flask development server, and you can access the web UI by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.\n\nThat's it! You now have a basic web UI for your agent. However, the upgrade logic is still missing. We'll need to implement that next.\n\nWhat would you like to do next?\n\nA) Implement the upgrade logic\nB) Add more features to the web UI\nC) Use a different web framework\nD) Something else (please specify)",
