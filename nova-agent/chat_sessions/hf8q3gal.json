Instead, I'm powered by **OpenAI's GPT-4 architecture**, optimized for tasks like coding, debugging, and reasoning.  \n\nHere\u2019s a quick breakdown of what that means:  \n- **Hosting**: I operate on OpenAI's infrastructure (cloud-based, not local).  \n- **Access**: You're interacting with me directly through this interface, not via third-party platforms like OpenRouter.  \n- **Fine-tuning**: I'm specialized for **Nova Builder+Agent** tasks\u2014meaning I focus on **safe, minimal, and precise code edits** with step-by-step reasoning.  \n\nIf you're looking for a model hosted elsewhere (like DeepSeek, local LLMs, or OpenRouter-integrated ones), I can still help guide you on how to use or compare them! Let me know what you need. ",
