As of now, **I'm primarily running on DeepSeek-V3**, and while I don't have **direct API access** to Groq, OpenRouter, or other third-party LLMs, some versions of Nova (like Nova Builder+Agent) might integrate different backends depending on deployment.  \n\nHowever, in this current session, **I'm operating purely on DeepSeek's infrastructure**\u2014meaning my responses are generated by DeepSeek-V3 without routing through external models like Groq or OpenRouter.  \n\nIf you're looking for speed comparisons (e.g., Groq's LPUs) or multi-model access (like OpenRouter), I can still help analyze those options! Let me know what you need. \ud83d\ude80",
