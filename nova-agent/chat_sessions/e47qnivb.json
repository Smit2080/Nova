    "message": "**Method Overloading in Java**\n\nMethod overloading is a feature in Java that allows multiple methods with the same name to be defined, as long as they have different parameter lists. Here's an example of method overloading in Java:\n\n```java\npublic class Calculator {\n    public int add(int a, int b) {\n        return a + b;\n    }\n\n    public double add(double a, double b) {\n        return a + b;\n    }\n\n    public int add(int a, int b, int c) {\n        return a + b + c;\n    }\n\n    public void add(int a, int b, int c, int d) {\n        System.out.println(\"Adding \" + a + \", \" + b + \", \" + c + \", and \" + d);\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();\n\n        // Overloading with different data types\n        System.out.println(\"Adding 2 and 3: \" + calculator.add(2, 3));\n        System.out.println(\"Adding 2.5 and 3.7: \" + calculator.add(2.5, 3.7));\n\n        // Overloading with different number of parameters\n        System.out.println(\"Adding 2, 3, and 4: \" + calculator.add(2, 3, 4));\n        calculator.add(2, 3, 4, 5);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Method Overloading in Python**\n\nMethod overloading is not directly supported in Python, but you can achieve similar results using default argument values or variable-length argument lists. Here's an example of method overloading in Python:\n\n```python\nclass Calculator:\n    def add(self, a, b, c=None, d=None):\n        if c is None and d is None:\n            return a + b\n        elif c is not None and d is None:\n            return a + b + c\n        else:\n            return a + b + c + d\n\ncalculator = Calculator()\n\n# Overloading with different data types\nprint(\"Adding 2 and 3: \", calculator.add(2, 3))\nprint(\"Adding 2.5 and 3.7: \", calculator.add(2.5, 3.7))\n\n# Overloading with different number of parameters\nprint(\"Adding 2, 3, and 4: \", calculator.add(2, 3, 4))\nprint(\"Adding 2, 3, 4, and 5: \", calculator.add(2, 3, 4, 5))\n```\n\n**Method Overloading in C++**\n\nMethod overloading is supported in C++ using function overloading. Here's an example of method overloading in C++:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nclass Calculator {\npublic:\n    int add(int a, int b) {\n        return a + b;\n    }\n\n    double add(double a, double b) {\n        return a + b;\n    }\n\n    int add(int a, int b, int c) {\n        return a + b + c;\n    }\n\n    void add(int a, int b, int c, int d) {\n        std::cout << \"Adding \" << a << \", \" << b << \", \" << c << \", and \" << d << std::endl;\n    }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    Calculator calculator;\n\n    // Overloading with different data types\n    std::cout << \"Adding 2 and 3: \" << calculator.add(2, 3) << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Adding 2.5 and 3.7: \" << calculator.add(2.5, 3.7) << std::endl;\n\n    // Overloading with different number of parameters\n    std::cout << \"Adding 2, 3, and 4: \" << calculator.add(2, 3, 4) << std::endl;\n    calculator.add(2, 3, 4, 5);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nNote that method overloading is not directly supported in C# and JavaScript, but you can achieve similar results using other programming techniques.",
