To fix this, we can simply add a check to ensure that `y` is not zero before performing the division:\n```python\ndef run_app():\n    try:\n        x = 10\n        y = 0\n        if y != 0:\n            result = x / y\n            logger.info(f\"Result: {result}\")\n        else:\n            logger.error(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Unexpected error: {e}\")\n```\nThis should fix the issue and prevent the `ZeroDivisionError` from occurring.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
