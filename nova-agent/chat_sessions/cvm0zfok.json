This function is called for each user in the list, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).\n* The `reverse=True` argument sorts the list in descending order, which does not affect the time complexity.\n* The space complexity is O(n) because the `sorted()` function creates a new list containing the sorted elements.\n\nNote: The time complexity of O(n log n) is due to the Timsort algorithm's use of merge sort, which has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case.",
