    "message": "I'll help you disable Groq and test Deepseek. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Disabling Groq** - This typically means removing or commenting out Groq-related configurations\n2. **Testing Deepseek** - We'll need to set up and verify Deepseek functionality\n\nCould you clarify a few things so I can give you the most accurate help:\n1. What language/framework are you working with? (Python, JavaScript, etc.)\n2. Are you using any specific SDKs or libraries for these services?\n3. What kind of testing do you want to perform on Deepseek? (API connectivity, response validation, etc.)\n\nFor now, here's a general Python example of how this might look:\n\n```python\n# Original config with both services\nconfig = {\n    'ai_services': {\n        'groq': {  # This will be disabled\n            'api_key': 'your_groq_key',\n            'enabled': True\n        },\n        'deepseek': {\n            'api_key': 'your_deepseek_key',\n            'enabled': True\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n# Disable Groq\nconfig['ai_services']['groq']['enabled'] = False\n\n# Test Deepseek\ndef test_deepseek():\n    if config['ai_services']['deepseek']['enabled']:\n        print(\"Testing Deepseek...\")\n        # Add your actual test logic here\n        # Example: make API call, validate response\n        return True\n    return False\n\nif test_deepseek():\n    print(\"Deepseek test successful\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Deepseek test failed\")\n```\n\nWould you like me to adapt this example to your specific use case? Or would you prefer examples in another language?",
